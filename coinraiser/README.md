# Coinraiser
<p>
    In Coinraiser, campaign contributors can have a say in
    where the funded money goes to. 
</p>
<p>
    Campaign organizers must send a request to the contributors
    whenever they want to send money to a vendor. 
</p>
<p>
    Contributors then vote whether or not they approve the request. 
</p>
<p>
    This way, campaign organizers will spend 100% of funded money
    to the creation of the product!
